# Velero Plugin for vSphere

![Velero Plugin For vSphere CICD Pipeline](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-vsphere/workflows/Velero%20Plugin%20For%20vSphere%20CICD%20Pipeline/badge.svg)

## Overview

This repository contains the Velero Plugin for vSphere.  This plugin provides crash-consistent snapshots of vSphere block volumes and backup of volume data into S3 compatible storage.

## Latest release

[v1.1.0](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-vsphere/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

## Kubernetes distributions

**Velero Plugin for vSphere** supports the following Kubernetes distributions:

- [Vanilla Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
- [vSphere with Tanzu](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2019/08/introducing-project-pacific.html)
- [Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service/TKGS](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/03/vsphere-7-tanzu-kubernetes-clusters.html)

For more information on **vSphere with Tanzu**, (formerly known as **vSphere with Kubernetes** and **Project Pacific**), and especially for information about the role of the Supervisor Cluster, please see [vSphere with Tanzu Configuration and Management](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-kubernetes/GUID-152BE7D2-E227-4DAA-B527-557B564D9718.html).

For more information on TKGS, the ```Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service```, please see [Provisioning and Managing Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters Using the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-kubernetes/GUID-7E00E7C2-D1A1-4F7D-9110-620F30C02547.html).

## Important note on vSphere with Tanzu networking requirements

**vSphere with Tanzu** supports two distinct networking deployments with the release of vSphere 7.0 Update 1 (U1). The first deployment leverages ```NSX-T``` to provide load balancing services as well as overlay networking for Pod VM to Pod VM communication in the Supervisor Cluster. The second networking configuration supported by vSphere with Tanzu uses native vSphere network distributed switches and a ```HA Proxy``` to provide load balancing services. Native vSphere networking does not provide any overlay networking capabilities, and thus this deployment does not currently support Pod VMs in the Supervisor. Since Pod VMs are a requirement when wish to use the **Velero Plugin for vSphere** in vSphere with Tanzu, it currently requires a networking deployment that uses NSX-T. vSphere with Tanzu deployments that use native vSphere distributed switch networking and the HA Proxy for load balancing cannot currently be backed up using the Velero Plugin for vSphere.

**TKGS** is the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service, a service available in vSphere with Tanzu to enable the deployment of TKG (guest) clusters in vSphere with Tanzu namespaces. Whilst TKGS is available in both deployments types of vSphere with Tanzu (NSX-T and native vSphere networking), the ability to backup TKGS guest clusters also requires the Supervisor Cluster to have the Velero Plugin for vSphere to be installed in the Supervisor Cluster. Since this is not possible with vSphere with Tanzu which uses native vSphere distributed switch networking, the Velero Plugin for vSphere is currently unable to backup and restore TKG guest clustes in these deployments.
