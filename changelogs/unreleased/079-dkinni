This change enables canceling on going uploads.
On each upload an cancellation function is extracted from
the context and registered into the data mover until it is
completed. In the meanwhile if a request to delete the backup
is received, a check is made to see if any node is uploading,
if found the cancel function is triggered. The cancel function
cleans up any previously uploaded data, eventually moving the
state of upload to "canceled"
