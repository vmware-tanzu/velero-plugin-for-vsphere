## Prerequisites

* [Install Data Manager](supervisor-datamgr.md)
* The following vSphere privileges are required if users do not have an Administrator role in vSphere.
    * SupervisorServices.Manage
    * Namespaces.Manage
    * Namespaces.Configure
 

## Install

In vSphere with Kubernetes Supervisor cluster, users are supposed to leverage `Velero vSphere Operator` to install velero
as well as velero-plugin-for-vsphere, since vSphere users who install velero don't have cluster-admin role in Supervisor
cluster. Please refer to
[Installing Velero on Supervisor cluster](velero-vsphere-operator-user-manual.md#installing-velero-on-supervisor-cluster)
for the detail.

**Note**: `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI that comes along with `Velero vSphere Operator` is aim to provide similar user
experience as Velero CLI in install and uninstall operations. For other Velero operations, users are still supposed to
use Velero CLI.

## Uninstall

In vSphere with Kubernetes Supervisor cluster, users are also supposed to use `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI to uninstall
[Uninstalling Velero on Supervisor cluster](velero-vsphere-operator-user-manual.md#uninstalling-velero-on-supervisor-cluster)
for the detail.

**Note**: Disable the `Velero vSphere Operator` Supervisor Service in vSphere will also uninstall velero as well as
velero-plugin-for-vsphere in Supervisor cluster. However, as a best practice, it is recommended to uninstall velero and
velero-plugin-for-vsphere using `Velero vSphere Operator CLI`.
