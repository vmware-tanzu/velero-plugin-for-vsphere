## Prerequisites

* [Install Data Manager](supervisor-datamgr.md)
* The following vSphere privileges are required if users do not have an Administrator role in vSphere.
  * SupervisorServices.Manage
  * Namespaces.Manage
  * Namespaces.Configure
* Download `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI [from here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-vsphere/releases/download/v1.1.0/velero-vsphere-1.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz).

## vSphere with Tanzu notes

Please read [vSphere with Tanzu notes](supervisor-notes.md) before moving forward with the following sections.

## Install

In a **vSphere with Tanzu** Supervisor cluster, users are supposed to leverage `Velero vSphere Operator` to install velero as well as velero-plugin-for-vsphere, since vSphere users who install velero don't have cluster-admin role in Supervisor cluster. Please refer to
[Installing Velero on Supervisor cluster](velero-vsphere-operator-user-manual.md#installing-velero-on-supervisor-cluster)
for the detail.

**Note**: `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI that comes with `Velero vSphere Operator` aims to provide a similar user experience as the Velero CLI in install and uninstall operations. For other Velero operations, users must continue to use the Velero CLI. Please download `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI [from here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero-plugin-for-vsphere/releases/download/v1.1.0/velero-vsphere-1.1.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz) if you haven't done so.

### Install with self-signed certificate

**Note**: Currently self-signed certificate is not supported on supervisor cluster, please refer to [velero-plugin-for-vsphere with a storage provider secured by a self-signed certificate](self-signed-certificate.md).

## Uninstall

In a vSphere with Tanzu Supervisor cluster, users should use `Velero vSphere Operator` CLI to uninstall [Uninstalling Velero on Supervisor cluster](velero-vsphere-operator-user-manual.md#uninstalling-velero-on-supervisor-cluster).

**Note**: Disabling the `Velero vSphere Operator` Supervisor Service will also uninstall Velero as well as the ```velero-plugin-for-vsphere``` in the Supervisor cluster. However, as a best practice, it is recommended to uninstall velero and velero-plugin-for-vsphere using `Velero vSphere Operator CLI`.

## Backup

The backup workflow in a vSphere with Tanzu Supervisor cluster is the same as that in Vanilla Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to [Backup vSphere CNS Block Volumes](vanilla.md#backup-vsphere-cns-block-volumes) in Vanilla Kubernetes Cluster document.

## Restore

In a vSphere with Tanzu Supervisor cluster, users need to take extra steps via either vSphere UI or VMware [DCLI](https://code.vmware.com/web/tool/3.0.0/vmware-datacenter-cli) before restoring a workload.

1. Create a namespace in Supervisor cluster.
2. Configure the Storage policy in the namespace.

The rest of restore workflow in a vSphere with Tanzu Supervisor cluster is the same as that in Vanilla Kubernetes cluster. Please refer to [Restore](vanilla.md#restore) in Vanilla Kubernetes Cluster document.
